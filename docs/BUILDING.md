# Building & developing WinterMP

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8+ (builds everything; the plugins target net35 via reference assemblies)
- Windows (the game and launcher are Windows-only)
- A My Winter Car install — the plugins compile against the game's own
  `UnityEngine.dll` (Unity 5.0) and `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll` (embedded
  Steamworks.NET). Set the path in `Directory.Build.props.user`.
  Only `WinterMP.Net` + tests + launcher build without the game.

## Build & test

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

`WinterMP.Net` + tests build anywhere; `WinterMP.Core`/`WinterMP.Tools` pull
BepInEx packages from the BepInEx NuGet feed (configured in `NuGet.config`)
and reference UnityEngine/Steamworks from the game install.

> Game profile (verified on build 23268598): Unity 5.0, legacy Mono with the
> .NET 3.5 profile → everything loaded in-game targets `net35`, and
> `WinterMP.Net` multi-targets `net35;netstandard2.0`.

## Deploying into the game

1. Install BepInEx 5 x64 (5.4.23+) into the game folder and apply the MWC
   entrypoint fix (`[Preloader.Entrypoint] Type = MonoBehaviour` in
   `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg`). The launcher's *Install / Repair* button
   applies the config fix automatically once BepInEx is extracted.
2. Copy `Directory.Build.props.user.example` → `Directory.Build.props.user`
   and set `MwcGamePath`.
3. `dotnet build` — the plugins (and `WinterMP.Net.dll` / `Steamworks.NET.dll`)
   auto-deploy to `<game>\BepInEx\plugins\WinterMP\`.

## Dev loop

- **F8** in game: starts a loopback session (host + fake guest in one process)
  — exercises the full handshake/chat/ping path without Steam or a second PC.
- **F9** in game (Tools plugin): dumps the FSM/object catalog to
  `<game>\WinterMP\dumps\catalog-*.json`. Commit interesting dumps to
  `catalog/` (named by game build) and diff them across game updates.
- **T** in game: chat. **TAB** (hold): player list + session status.
- Logs: `<game>\BepInEx\LogOutput.log`.

## Launcher (release packaging)

```powershell
.\tools\build-launcher.ps1          # dev build → bin\Release\net8.0-windows\
.\tools\publish-release.ps1         # self-contained win-x64 + dist\*.zip
.\tools\build-installer.ps1         # publish + WinterMP-Setup.exe (installs Inno Setup via winget if needed)
```

Release zips land in `dist/`:
`WinterMP-Launcher-win-x64.zip` (full launcher) and `WinterMP-payload.zip`
(attach to GitHub releases for in-launcher mod updates).

Player guide: [PLAYERS.md](PLAYERS.md).

Agent routing: [CODEMAP.md](CODEMAP.md), [AGENT-RECIPES.md](AGENT-RECIPES.md).

## Testing real multiplayer

Steam allows one running instance per account, so end-to-end tests need either
two machines/accounts, or the loopback transport for protocol-level work.
Protocol logic should always land with unit tests in `WinterMP.Net.Tests`
first — that's the loop that runs in CI.

## Command line

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-wintermp host` | Create a friends-only lobby after boot (what the launcher's HOST does) |
| `-wintermp join <lobbyId>` | Join a specific lobby |
| `+connect_lobby <lobbyId>` | Set by Steam's invite/Join Game flow; honored automatically |
| `-wintermp hostlocal [port]` | Host a localhost UDP test session (no Steam) |
| `-wintermp joinlocal [addr:port]` | Join a localhost UDP test session |
| `-wintermp-playername <name>` | Display-name override (test tooling) |
| `-wintermp-autoload` | **Deprecated** — auto-load is always on via WinterMP FastBoot when a save exists |
| `-wintermp-doortest <sec>` | Self-test: auto open/close the WC door N seconds after world sync is ready; acks via chat |
